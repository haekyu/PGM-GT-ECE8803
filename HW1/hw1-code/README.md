# Hidden Markov Models

## Author: Haekyu Park

## Directory structure
- `./code`
	- `baseline.py`
		- This solves `4.1 Baseline` problem.
		- It generates `gene_test.p1.out`.
	- `hmm_trigram.py`
		- This solves `4.2 HMM with trigram features` problem.
		- It generates `gene_test.p2.out`.
	- `run_eval_baseline.sh`
		- This shell file evaluates baseline result.
	- `run_eval_viterbi.sh`
		- This shell file evaluates viterbi result.
	- `run_gene_count.sh`
		- This shell file generates the count files with `_RARE_` word.
- `./hmm`
	- This includes helper functions that are provided by the homework assignment, such as:
		- `count_freqs.py`
		- `eval_gene_tagger.py`
	- This includes datasets given by the homework assignment, such as:
		- `gene.key`
		- `gene.test`
		- `gene.train`
	- This includes datasets generated by the homework solution, such as:
		- `gene.new.counts`: a new count of words that includes `_RARE_`.
		- `gene.new.train`: a new training set that includes `_RARE_` word.
		- `gene_test.p1.out`: the output of 4.1.
		- `gene_test.p2.out`: the output of 4.2.
- `./result`
	- This includes `gene_test.p1.out` and `gene_test.p2.out`, copied from those in `./hmm`.

## How to run the code
- To evaluate the solution for 4.1, run `baseline.py` by `python baseline.py` in `./code`.
- To evaluate the solution for 4.2, run `hmm_trigram.py` by `python hmm_trigram.py` in `./code`.
